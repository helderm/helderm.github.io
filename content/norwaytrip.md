Summary: All about the hiking trip plan to the Norway fjords that will happen this summer
Status: published

### The plan

* When?

From 2016-08-13 to 2016-08-17

* Where?

Stavanger -> Preikestolen -> Kjerat -> Trolltunga -> Stavanger

* How?

By car, camping in the wild or in camping sites.


### General tips

We can camp almost anywhere in Norway. If accomodation is a price issue, we can always pitch our tents somewhere in the wild and save some money.

The idea is to move as close as possible to the next hike the night before, so we can wake up early and go straight to the trail.

### Day 0: Stockholm (2016-08-12)

* Stockholm -> Oslo ([tickets](https://www.sj.se/travel/booksearchlocation.form))

Departs 16h, arrives 21h

* Oslo -> Stavanger ([tickets](https://www.nsb.no/en/frontpage))

Departs 22h15, arrives 7h (check this again!)

### Day 1: [Preikestolen] (2016-08-13)

![alt text][preikestolen_img]

The starting point of the trip is the city of [Stavanger](https://goo.gl/maps/YFr8Fj3whop]). There are two main ways to get here: by [train](https://goo.gl/7xP6nc) coming from Oslo or by [plane](https://goo.gl/BHLNxd).

First thing to do is to get the car from the car rental company at 10AM.

Buy supplies for the trip (food etc.)

The hike should last about 6h, so prepare everything before leaving.

Enjoy the nature, relax, take some cool photos!

After that, we move closer to our next hike, Kjerag, thorough the ferry line Lysebotn-Forsand, which costs around 705 NOK for a car + passengers, might be a good option since the view seems to be amazing! More info about the ferry [here](https://goo.gl/Uw6M7Z). Ferry departs at 9h and 15h10, and the trip is 2h30 long. **Pay attention to the time!**

We can camp at [Lysebotn Tourist Camp] but it has low reviews in Trip Advisor and an expensive price, so it might be better to camp in the wild.

### Day 2: [Kjerag] (2016-08-14)

![alt text][kjerag_img]

Wake up early, pack all our stuff, and go straight to Kjerag! It is a hard hike, so prepare acordingly.

Next stop is Trolltunga. We must get to Odda somehow from Lysebotn. One option is to go to Songesand through the Lysebotn-Songesand ferry and take road FV661, and then take RV13 up until Hjelmeland. From there, take the Nesvik-Hjelmeland ferry to Nesvik, and continue through RV13. After 150km we get to Odda.

[Odda Camping] is quite close to the hike, but I couldn't find the price. Reviews from TripAdvisor say it is cheap though.

### Day 3: [Trolltunga] (2016-08-15)

![alt text][trolltunga_img]

Wake up *very* early, pack all our stuff, and go!

This hike is 22km long! It will take around 11h to get there and back, so be prepared!

Go to Gjendesheim and camp for the night.

### Day 4: Bessegen Ridge (2016-08-16)

### Day 5: Mt. Skåla (2016-08-17)

### Day 6: Geiranger (2016-08-18)

### Day 7: Bergen and back (2016-08-19)
