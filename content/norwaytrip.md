### General tips

* We can camp almost anywhere in Norway. If accomodation is a price issue, we can always pitch our tents somewhere in the wild and save some money.

* Transportation seems to be the greatest of the trip costs. Some one-way bus tickets can cost more than 100 NOK for a small stretch. Hitchhiking whenever possible should save us a lot of money, so we should be prepared for that.

* With enough people, a car could be a better idea than taking the bus everywhere. Some ferry trips may be cheaper, and the busses are so expensive that it may be worth it. I could find for 6 days at the end of August for 3000 NOK, which is reasonable.

* The idea is to move as close as possible to the next hike the night before, so we can wake up early and go straight to the trail.

### Day 1: Stavanger

* The starting point of the trip is the city of [Stavanger](https://goo.gl/maps/YFr8Fj3whop]). There are two main ways to get here: by [train](https://goo.gl/7xP6nc) coming from Oslo or by [plane](https://goo.gl/BHLNxd). A good discount can be obtained by students if travelling by train, the total cost for the 2-way trip from Stockholm cost around 1000 NOK.

* This is a good spot to buy supplies for the trip, so don't forget to buy food etc. before leaving 

* A good option for camping would be [Preikestolen Camping](http://goo.gl/gQcwmu), which has a fairly inexpensive (or so it seems) price if you bring you own tent (40 NOK, + 40 NOK for eletricity).

* We should take a bus to Jørpeland, that trip takes about 2h. Bus timetables can be checked [here](https://goo.gl/iJ3h8). The website doesn't tell me how much the ticket costs, but I read somewhere that it was around 150 NOK. Probably a ferry trip to Tau will be involved, around 47 NOK one way.

* Hitchhiking from Stavanger to Preikestolen should be easy. We could stop by the ferry boat and try our luck. Maybe we can get a ride to Tau and from there move down to Jørpeland.


### Day 2: Preikestolen

* Wake up early and start packing! Follow the signs and find the trail. The hike should last about 6h, so prepare everything before leaving.

* Enjoy the nature, relax, take some cool photos!

* After that, we move closer to our next hike, Kjerag. The closest camping that I found is [this one](http://goo.gl/nXHDll). The price is a bit confusing, it says 220 NOK for a car and a 2-person tent, so I'd expect way less than that.

* The bus to Kjerag is turning to be a challenge to find. The only one that I found was a [coach bus](http://www.tidereiser.com/hikingtour-kjerag#attached-page-toggler-tourlist) from Stavanger which costs 550 NOK per person, kinda expensive. Hitchhiking might be an option here. A post about this trip can be found [here](https://goo.gl/Y3xb9R). The bus departs at 7h30m, arrives at Øygardstøl at 11h, and departs at 16h45.

* There is a public bus that goes from Botne to Forsand, and there is a ferry line Lysebotn-Forsand that we could use. The bus line is 108, and the stop is Forsand Kai. The Lysebotn-Forsand ferry trip costs 300 NOK per person one way, or 705 NOK for a car + passengers, might be a good option since the view seems to be amazing! More info about the ferry [here](https://goo.gl/Uw6M7Z). A good strategy might be to go to the ferry and try to hitchike our way to Lysebotn. Ferry departs at 9h and 15h10, and the trip is 2h30 long.

### Day 3: Kjerag

* Wake up early, pack all our stuff, and go straight to Kjerag! It is a hard hike, so prepare acordingly.

* Next stop is Trolltunga. We must get to Odda somehow from Lysebotn. One option is to go to Songesand through the Lysebotn-Songesand ferry and take road FV661, and then take RV13 up until Hjelmeland. From there, take the Nesvik-Hjelmeland ferry to Nesvik, and continue through RV13. After 150km we get to Odda.

* We could try to get a ride in one of the ferries, but I think we would need to be very lucky to get something from Lysebotn to Odda. Maybe we could hithchike to Tau since it is a larger city.
