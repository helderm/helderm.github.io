Title: About

I've always been the nerdy kind of guy. I've been tinkering with computers since the time that we had to plug them on the TV, if we can call that a computer at all. Even though my main reason at that time for my curiosity was to play new games on that strange little box, that inadvertently started a slowly growing passion for technology that is still going strong today.

I'm a Computer Science BS that recently got accepted at KTH's Machine Learning Master course. In the coming months I'll be moving from my hometown in Brazil to embark in this journey of living abroad in Sweden, and this is a place where I can ramble about my passions.
