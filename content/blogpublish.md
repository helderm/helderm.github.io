I consider myself a practical kind of guy. So when I sought a way of publishing my personal space on the web, I searched for tools that did the job without much hassle, and that did offer some sort of customizations. Being a Python programmer by heart, I ran into this very nice static site generator called [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), and instantly fell with in love with it. So what would be a better first post than telling how I set this blog up!

Today I'll be telling how:

+ Create your own blog using Pelican

+ Hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

+ Automatically deploy it using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
